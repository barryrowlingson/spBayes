	* 0.3-5
	* Added spDynLM, bayesGeostatExact, and bayesLMConjugate. Modified spPredict to accept bayesGeostatExact objects. Added several additional illustrative data sets.

	* 0.3-4
	* Temporarily commented out #pragma omp parallel regions in C++ code called by spMvLM and spMvGLM until I can figure out some inconsistent behavior that only seems to occur when cov.model=matern.

	* 0.3-3
	* Fixed bug in spLMPredict.cpp that caused the posterior predictive distribution to be too narrow when spLM was called with no nugget.

	* 0.3-2
	* Fixed bug in spDiag.R and spPredict.R associated with bayesLMRef.R Added keywords to serveral Rd files. Added spPPMvGLMPredict.cpp.

	* 0.3-1
	* Fixed bug in spMvGLMPredict.cpp that effected prediction using spGLM and spMvGLM for observed locations only. Prediction for unobserved locations was not effected.
	* Added three example data sets.
